COMPANY: CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS

NAME: YUVASRI.K

INTERN ID: CITS0D09

DOMAIN: PYTHON PROGRAMMING

DURATION: 4 WEEKS

MENTOR: NEELA SANTOSH

DESCRIPTION: IMPORT NECESSARY LIBRARIES:

NUMPY: FOR NUMERICAL OPERATIONS

PANDAS: FOR DATA HANDLING (OPTIONAL HERE BUT GOOD PRACTICE)

SCIKIT-LEARN MODULES: FOR MACHINE LEARNING TASKS

LOAD THE IRIS DATASET:

THE IRIS DATASET IS A POPULAR PRELOADED DATASET IN SCIKIT-LEARN.

IT CONTAINS FEATURES (SEPAL LENGTH, SEPAL WIDTH, PETAL LENGTH, PETAL WIDTH)

TARGET VARIABLE (FLOWER SPECIES)

SPLIT THE DATA INTO TRAINING AND TESTING:

TRAINING DATA IS USED TO TRAIN THE MODEL

TESTING DATA IS USED TO CHECK THE MODEL'S PERFORMANCE

FUNCTION USED: TRAIN_TEST_SPLIT

CREATE AND TRAIN A MACHINE LEARNING MODEL:

THE MODEL USED IS RANDOMFORESTCLASSIFIER

IT IS A POWERFUL CLASSIFICATION ALGORITHM BASED ON DECISION TREES

THE MODEL IS TRAINED USING model.fit()

MAKE PREDICTIONS ON TEST DATA:

PREDICT THE SPECIES OF FLOWERS USING THE TEST DATA

FUNCTION USED: model.predict()

EVALUATE THE MODEL PERFORMANCE:

CALCULATE ACCURACY USING accuracy_score

DISPLAY A CLASSIFICATION REPORT USING classification_report

METRICS SHOWN: PRECISION, RECALL, F1-SCORE, SUPPORT

PRINT THE RESULTS TO THE CONSOLE:

THE PROGRAM PRINTS THE MODEL ACCURACY AND THE DETAILED CLASSIFICATION REPORT.

OUTPUT OF THE PROGRAM:
THE ACCURACY OF THE MODEL (USUALLY 100% FOR THE IRIS DATASET BECAUSE IT IS SIMPLE)

CLASSIFICATION REPORT SHOWING HOW WELL THE MODEL PERFORMED ON EACH CLASS (FLOWER SPECIES)

TOOLS AND LIBRARIES USED:
LIBRARY	PURPOSE
NUMPY	NUMERICAL COMPUTATIONS
PANDAS	DATA HANDLING
SCIKIT-LEARN (sklearn)	MACHINE LEARNING IMPLEMENTATION
RANDOMFORESTCLASSIFIER	CLASSIFICATION ALGORITHM
TRAIN_TEST_SPLIT	DATA SPLITTING FUNCTION
ACCURACY_SCORE	TO MEASURE MODEL ACCURACY
